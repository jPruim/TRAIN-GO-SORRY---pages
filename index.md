## TRAIN GO SORRY Vision
There are many American Sign Language (ASL) dictionaries and study tools that allow a user to look up a word and see its sign, but there are limited tools for users to identify a sign from a video. This is problematic for learners because any person learning a new language must be able to communicate both expressively and receptively. This means that people must be able to speak/sign the language (expressive), in addition to understanding others when they speak/sign the language (receptive). ASL dictionaries provide videos with the name of the sign already visible, so users are not able to guess what is being signed in order to practice their receptive skills. Without proper receptive learning tools, it is more difficult for a person to learn on their own.

For example, imagine yourself waving to someone. When you do this, you see the back of your hand waving on the right (or left) side of you. Now imagine someone else waving to you. This time you see the palm of their hand waving on the left (or right) side of you. When you are signing in ASL, you see a different view of your hands (palm-orientation) and the left and right sides of your view (visual-spatial plane) are flipped compared to watching someone else sign. For this reason, understanding what someone else is signing can be confusing.

This is where TRAIN GO SORRY comes in. TRAIN GO SORRY is a free, receptive American Sign Language (ASL) study tool. The purpose of this tool is to provide ASL students with a way to test their ability to recognize signs and improve their receptive skills.

We will provide a web-based platform for ASL students to build lists of ASL signs they wish to study from a dictionary of sign videos we provide. A student can choose to study one or more lists at a time. While studying, TRAIN GO SORRY will show a random video from the list(s) of words the student chose to study. The student must identify the sign in the video by inputting the name of the sign in GLOSS. ASL GLOSS is a written approximation of ASL where each sign has a designated label (written in all caps) along with other notes about how something is to be signed. 

Once the user submits their guess, they will be told if their answer is correct or incorrect. If the student is incorrect, they may choose to continue to the next word or try again. Their overall success and progress will be shown on the page. This will allow people to test their ability to recognize signs and allow them to improve their receptive ASL skills.

## Changes to Project Proposal
TODO: WE NEED SOMETHING ABOUT TESTING HERE

## Design Norm - Cultural Appropriateness
Throughout the development of this project, we have been focusing on the design norm of Cultural Appropriateness. In short, Culteral Appropriateness means that "technology should alleviate burdens while still preserving what is good" (From Professor Schuurman’s [“Redemption and Responsible Technology”](https://digitalcollections.dordt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2949&context=pro_rege), page 8).  
For us, this means that TRAIN GO SORRY should make studying and communicating with ASL easier, without taking away from ASL or Deaf culture, and without taking away from the student's learning success.
